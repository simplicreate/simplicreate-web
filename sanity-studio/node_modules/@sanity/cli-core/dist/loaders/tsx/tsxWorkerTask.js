/**
 * Executes a worker file with tsx registered. This means you can import other
 * typescript with fairly rich syntax, and still have that only apply to the worker
 * thread instead of the full parent process. The worker should emit a message when
 * complete using `parentPort`. Once it has received a single message will resolve the
 * returned promise with that message. If you are expecting multiple messages, you will
 * have to implement another method ;)
 *
 * @param filePath - Path to the worker file
 * @param options - Options to pass to the worker
 * @returns A promise that resolves with the message from the worker
 * @throws If the file does not exist
 * @throws If the worker exits with a non-zero code
