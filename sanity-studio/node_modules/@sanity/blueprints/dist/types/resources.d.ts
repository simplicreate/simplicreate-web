 *  - **replace** if a stack is deployed, the resource will be destroyed and created instead of performing an update. If the resource is removed from the blueprint, it will be destroyed. If the stack is destroyed, the resource will be destroyed.
 *  - **allow** if a stack is destroyed, the resource will be destroyed along with it. If the resource is removed it will be destroyed
 *  - **protect** if a stack is deployed the resource will not be updated. If the resource is removed from the blueprint or the stack is destroyed, deployment will fail.
